    <h1>Modern Practices and Ecosystem Trends</h1>

    <h2>1. GitOps â€“ Version Control Meets DevOps</h2>
    <p>GitOps extends DevOps by using Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and deployments. Infrastructure changes are made through commits and pull requests, enabling automated and auditable deployments. Tools like ArgoCD and FluxCD synchronize systems directly from Git repositories.</p>

    <h2>2. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
    <p>Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every code commit triggers automated builds and tests. Continuous Deployment (CD) automates releasing tested code into production. Version control systems connect these steps, ensuring traceability, rollback, and faster delivery.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every change is linked to a specific commit.</li>
        <li>Pull requests act as quality gates for merging code.</li>
        <li>Automation minimizes human error in releases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cloud-Based Platforms</h2>
    <p>Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket combine version control with collaboration tools. They include issue tracking, integrated CI/CD, and social coding. GitHub alone hosts over 100 million developers, showing how central cloud VCS platforms have become.</p>

    <h2>4. AI in Code Management</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence enhances version control by assisting in code review, detecting vulnerabilities, and even suggesting fixes. Tools like GitHub Copilot and AI-based reviewers automate repetitive work, improving code quality and productivity.</p>

    <h2>5. The Future</h2>
    <p>Version control continues to evolve, integrating with automation, cloud ecosystems, and intelligent tooling. The focus is shifting toward smarter workflows, reproducible environments, and global collaboration supported by distributed systems.</p>
