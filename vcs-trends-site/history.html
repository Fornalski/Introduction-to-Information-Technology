    <h1>Historical Milestones in Version Control</h1>

    <p>The evolution of version control spans several decades, beginning with local systems and progressing to global distributed tools. Below is a brief timeline of major VCS developments:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>1972 – SCCS:</strong> One of the first systems, introduced at Bell Labs, tracked basic code changes.</li>
        <li><strong>1982 – RCS:</strong> Automated file versioning using delta storage; local only, for single files.</li>
        <li><strong>1986 – CVS:</strong> Extended RCS to support networked collaboration through a client-server model.</li>
        <li><strong>2000 – Subversion (SVN):</strong> Added atomic commits and improved branching; remained centralized.</li>
        <li><strong>2005 – Git & Mercurial:</strong> Introduced distributed version control; every user had a full repo copy.</li>
        <li><strong>2008 – GitHub:</strong> Web platform that transformed collaboration with pull requests and social coding.</li>
        <li><strong>2010s–2020s:</strong> Git became the global standard; GitOps, CI/CD, and cloud integration emerged.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why Distributed VCS Changed the Game</h2>
    <p>Distributed systems revolutionized collaboration by removing the dependency on a single central server. Developers could commit and branch locally, merge easily, and share changes flexibly. This model enabled massive projects such as the Linux kernel, with thousands of contributors worldwide, to operate efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Major Version Control Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RCS:</strong> Local versioning, suitable for single files.</li>
        <li><strong>CVS:</strong> Early multi-user VCS but lacked atomic commits.</li>
        <li><strong>Subversion:</strong> Reliable central system with better branching and merging.</li>
        <li><strong>Git:</strong> Fast, distributed, ideal for modern workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Mercurial:</strong> Similar to Git but simpler; used in some large projects.</li>
    </ul>
