    <h1>Version Control Systems (VCS) - Overview</h1>

    <p>Version Control Systems are essential tools that track changes in files and enable teams to collaborate on projects. They preserve a history of modifications and make it possible to revert to earlier versions when needed. Over time, VCS tools have evolved from centralized systems like RCS and Subversion to distributed systems like Git and Mercurial.</p>

    <h2>Why Version Control Matters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tracks every change to source code for accountability and recovery.</li>
        <li>Enables multiple developers to work together without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.</li>
        <li>Supports experimentation through branching and merging.</li>
        <li>Forms the backbone of modern DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud collaboration workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Centralized vs. Distributed Systems</h2>
    <p>Centralized systems store all files in a single repository on a server, requiring network access and offering a single source of truth. Distributed systems, like Git, give every developer a full copy of the repository, allowing local commits and offline work. Distributed systems dominate modern development because they are faster, more resilient, and encourage parallel collaboration.</p>
